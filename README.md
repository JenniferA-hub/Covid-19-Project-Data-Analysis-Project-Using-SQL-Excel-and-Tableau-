IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT

Covid-19 has been a prevalant problem in society ,since late 2019. It's important for individuals, pharmaceutical companies and healthcare officials to understand
the statistics around Covid-19,what they entail and how many individuals are susceptible to contracting the virus,the death rates,the number of people vaccinating
worldwide and how rapidly the virus will spread in the near future.

AIM

The aim of this project is to analyse the deaths,vaccinations,and Covid-19 cases worldwide. From there, compare the data as per population,location as well as
look at it ,in comparison to the global numbers of deaths,cases and its percentage global.

THIS WILL ANSWER THE FOLLOWING :

What is the projected forecast of Covid-19 infections per population?
Which continent has the highest death count from Covid-19?
Which population has the highest infection rate per location?



METHOD OF ANALYSIS


How this analysis will be conducted :

The use of Microsoft SQL server to query the necessary Covid-19 data we'd like to investigate
Cleaning the data by craeting new columns with grouped data split for more accessiblity and further analysis.
The database used is information obtained from 'Our World Data'.
Conversion of the SQL data fro the MS SQL server to Excel,for Tableau usablity 
Tableau for the dashboard and visualizations


SQL queries used in the project include:


CTE

Creating Views

Self-joins
Joins

Order by
Group by

Where 

Select statements

varchar

cast

sum

max

int and bigint

Aliases 


Is not null





THE CONCLUSION

Analysis has shown that we can expect an increase in Covid-19 cases in the next 12 months.

Europe has the highest death toll rate from Covid-19 ,in comparison to other continents 


THE VISUALIZATION PORTION OF THE PROJECT 
This Tableau dashboard serves as a visualization and finalization  of the 'Covid-19 Data Exploration' project.
This will summarize the important aspects of the investigation that will allow us to answer the three main questions,from 
the start of the analysis project. 

THE THREE INVESTIGATION QUESTIONS : 
 
What is the projected forecast of Covid-19 infections per population?

Which continent has the highest death count from Covid-19? 

Which population has the highest infection rate per location?

AIM

For the Covid-19 Data Exploration information to be easily presented, whilst using the raw data at a glance, to understand the entire investigation,
understand where the statistics were drawn from and easily see how conclusions were summarized and drawn.

METHODOLOGY

The SQL queries from the 'Covid-19 Data Exploration' project was used.
The Data obtained from the project was converted into an Excel 'xlsx' file.
The data that was moved from MS SQL server into MS Excel workbook was cleaned.
Cleaning involved removing any 'Null' values ,and converting commas into periods(for Tableau to read the information as numerical and not strings).
After the data cleaning, the relevant data was copied and saved into four different workbooks
The four workbooks were uploaded onto different Tableau Sheets and each Sheet represented a different visualization of Covid-19 data
The sheets were then combined into one Dashboard for an overall combination of the analysis



 CONCLUSIONS FROM THE DASHBOARD

Analysis has shown that we can expect an increase in Covid-19 cases in the next 12 months.

Europe has the highest death toll rate from Covid-19 ,in comparison to other continents

Faeroe Island has the highest infection rate per location,standing at 65%







Overall, this project was able to answer the three investigation questions asked in the beginning :

What is the projected forecast of Covid-19 infections per population?

Which continent has the highest death count from Covid-19? 

Which population has the highest infection rate per location?


Due to the results from the investigation ,one can conclude that Covid-19's impact on infecting individuals will not decrease in the next 12 months,therefore
precaution still needs to be taken to avoid contracting Covid-19.
Europe might need to consider more healthcare precautions to decrease the high death-toll rate that they're experiencing, in comparison to other continents.
Faeroe Island's high infection rate could be due to their small population of approximately 522000. More analysis and invetsigations need to be run further 
to determine the root-causes of the high infection rate in Faeroe Islands


 MORE ON THE CONCLUSION

The above analysis is not a limitation or an exhaustive outcome from the orginal dataset from the 'Covid-19 Data Exploration Project'.
There are more investigation questions that will be encouraged and analysed in the near future. For example, how does highly-vaccinated locations compare
to lowly-vaccinated locations. Does the vaccination impact warrant promotions or mandates for vaccines in lowly-vaccinated areas. Do vaccines have an impact
on the death toll of the highly-vaccinated loactions. 

Faeroe Island has the highest infection rate per location,standing at 65%
